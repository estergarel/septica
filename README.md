# Septica - Card Game in MATLAB

This project implements a simplified version of the card game "Septica" for two players in MATLAB.

## Description

"Septica" is a popular card game in Romania, and this implementation allows two players to compete in a simplified version. The goal of the game is to collect as many points as possible by matching cards with the same values.

## Features

- Shuffling a deck of cards
- Distributing cards to players
- Implementing game logic
- Calculating scores
- Declaring the winner

## Programming Techniques

This project utilizes various programming techniques, including:

- **Randomization**: Used for shuffling the deck of cards.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays and matrices are used to store player hands and game states.
- **Control Structures**: Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`) manage game flow.
- **Function-based Programming**: The game logic is modularized into separate functions for better organization and reusability.
- **User Interaction**: The game provides output messages and prompts for players to follow the game progress.

## Requirements

- MATLAB installed on the user's system

## Installation and Usage

1. Download the project from GitHub.
2. Extract the files into a local folder.
3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the main game file using the command:
   ```matlab
   run('main_file_name.m')
   ```
